				<p>Atelier series is a franchise of role-playing video games developed by the Gust Corporation since 1997, primarily for the PlayStation line of consoles (PlayStation, PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, and PlayStation 4); portable versions for the Game Boy Color, Game Boy Advance, Nintendo DS, Nintendo 3DS, PlayStation Portable, PlayStation Vita and WonderSwan Color have also been made. Two of the games in the series were ported to the Sega Saturn and Dreamcast. The series has been primarily released in Japan, though recent titles have been localized for other markets. The franchise centers around the concept of an atelier specialising in alchemy; the gameplay involves finding, collecting, and combining items in recipes to create better items, which allows the player to advance further in the game. A manga adaptation by Yoshihiko Ochi has also been published.</p>

				<p>Atelier Ayesha stars Ayesha Altugle, who runs an herbalist's workshop with her sister Nio. After Nio disappears mysteriously, Ayesha meets an alchemist called Keithgriff Hazeldine, who reveals that she must master the art of alchemy herself in order to rescue her sister, but she has only a few years to do so, or Nio will eventually be lost forever. Overcoming sadness is one of the game’s themes and players will see Ayesha grow as she writes diary entries, while she gathers allies and improves her alchemy skills in her quest to reunite with her missing sister.</p>
